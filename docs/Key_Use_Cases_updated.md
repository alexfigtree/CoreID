It depicts the user actions that a credit union member, third party, and credit union can take to 
affect the UI.  The main credit union member can take the following actions:

  - Login/Logout
  - Change User
  - View/Sign/Verify Documents
  - View/Sign/Verify Claims
  - Create Attestations

Third parties and the credit union can view documents and claims signed by the member, and add their 
own verification, documents, and claims, which are then re-rendered on the client member's UI.
